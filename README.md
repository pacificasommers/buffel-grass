Data from field and potted experiments on the effects of buffel grass on native perennials in the Sonoran Uplands

These data were collected from 2013-2015 in and around Tucson, Arizona. Aims and results of the experiment are described in my dissertation, entitled, "Interacting effects of predation and competition in the field and in theory."

They are furthermore the basis of a manuscript submitted to the journal Biological Invasions.
